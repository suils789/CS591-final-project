# CS591-final-projectThen, it’s able to use the model to compute all missing entries of our user-item matrix. Then, if we predict a user will rate highly to a game, we can recommend the game to that user. This method makes it possible to jump out of certain categories when recommending games to users, and because the MSE is acceptable, it’s safe to assume the predicted score would be accurate. 
One of the drawbacks of this method is it doesn’t take the user bias towards different types of games into account. For example, a user who tends to rate highly on sports game may give low star ratings on trivia games just because he thinks trivia games is boring(nothing with the game itself). And one way to improve could be taking advantages of the result of clustering in our approach one, because each cluster represents a category. In this way, we can calculate users’ bias towards different types of games, and add some adjustment terms for our regression formula.
